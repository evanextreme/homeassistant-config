# Evan's Home Assistant Config

![Yaml Lint](https://github.com/evanextreme/homeassistant-config/workflows/Yaml%20Lint/badge.svg)

Hello! This is my [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) config. It's a pretty basic config right now that'll get more complicated and cool with time. Security of course is paramount, so all my secrets are protected / hardened, and my instance is on a separate / protected ssl certified domain. Feel free to fork this or reach out to me via the issues for any help with it!
